## Software Design Preparations
### Data Transfer System for Production Industry
- Developed complete data ingestion pipeline to stream real-time data to the cloud using Elastic stack
- Data visualization and analysis using Kibana dashboard, predictive maintenance to be achieved


### High Performance Network Traffic Filtering Solution
The developed system was able to filter high rate traffic coming (40 Gbps). DPDK was used to bypass Kernel overhead and fast packet processing

### Serendipity
A file storage System, which was Redundant, Distributed, and Encrypted. We have used Python language as backend as well as for frontend.

### Yorkshire & Humber Care Record
BigQuery to fetch data from Google Cloud Platform, Python for Backend and D3.JS for front-end
